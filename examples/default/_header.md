# Default example

This example deploys the module in its simplest form.

It will deploy the IPAM as a publicly exposed WebApp with the UI disabled. However, as it deploys without a valid Engine app ID (i.e the example *"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"* ), the WebApp will be non-functional.

For an functional deployment, replace the examples variable inputs with actual App registration details.
